Technical Interview Questions
=============================

**General**
- Find the most frequent integer in an array
- Given 2 integer arrays, determine if the 2nd array is a rotated version of the 1st array.
    ```Ex. Original Array A={1,2,3,5,6,7,8} Rotated Array B={5,6,7,8,1,2,3}```
- We’re going to find “Word Twins”, which are pairs of English words, at least 4 letters long, where the first three letters of one are the last three letters of another.  For example, “strategy” and “Egypt”.
- Given a 3*3 matrix, and 1-8 numbers in random order, 1 place as space. 
        Write code to find the min exchange of numbers to make the matrix in order.
            
            5 4 1           1 2 3
            3   2   --->    8   4
            7 8 6           7 6 5

- There is k parenthesis, write code to calculate how many permutations could have. 
    For 2 parenthesis, there is 2 permutations: ()() and (()).
- **HARD**: Given a 2D array of 1s and 0s, count the number of "islands of 1s" (e.g. groups of connecting 1s)

**Strings**
- **HARD**: Given a single-line text String and a maximum width value, write the function 'String justify(String text, int maxWidth)' that formats the input text using full-justification, i.e., extra spaces on each line are equally distributed between the words; the first word on each line is flushed left and the last word on each line is flushed right

**Trees**
- Write a function that determines if a tree is a BST
