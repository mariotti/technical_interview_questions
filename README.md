# Technical Interview Questions: interesting problems

This is a repository of interesting (and less interesting) questions with solutions
given in many programming languages and by multiple authors.

As the repository is only at the beginning, we need contributions.

The basic idea is that no algorithm, no code is better then an other.
They are just different: one works better in one case the other better
in an other case.

Consider for example the different sorting algorithms: swap, heap, quick etc.
Each one is the best within its own context.

We can extend it to the programming languages: the same algorithm might
behave differently in one language then on an other, moreover we can have
different implementations for the same solution within the same programming
language.

The target is not to list the best: The target is to give ideas with
examples.

## Current Problems

There are many problems on this repository which I am trying to solve.
If you feel like contributing please let me know
