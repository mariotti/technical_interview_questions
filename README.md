# Technical Interview Questions: interesting problems

This is a repository of interesting (and less interesting) questions with solutions
given in many programming languages and by multiple authors.

As the repository is only at the beginning, we need contributions.

The basic idea is that no algorithm, no code is better then an other.
They are just different: one works better in one case the other better
in an other case.

Consider for example the different sorting algorithms: swap, heap, quick etc.
Each one is the best within its own context.

We can extend it to the programming languages: the same algorithm might
behave differently in one language then on an other, moreover we can have
different implementations for the same solution within the same programming
language.

The target is not to list the best: The target is to give ideas with
examples.

## Current Problems

There are many problems on this repository which I am trying to solve.
If you feel like contributing please let me know

# Current activity

Building a JSON "database" with references to solutions and discussions.

This is already a nice problem ;)

# How to contribute

There are at present many many ways you can contribute. If you feel like just start an issue.

## Language, understanding and related problems

 - Even within the short text presented in these pages, there are defintely typos and bad grammar. To contribute you might need to be a bit techky, and not to write a romance or too long correct sentences but any contribution is definitely appreciated. Teaching to tech guys a bit of writing style cannot be too bad.

 - I started with a given list of question. Some are not definitely clear. The idea is to create a document for each question in order to describe it better. But some questions are really bad. Please point them out.

## Question, Algo, text and solution

As the starting point is really not tested... the best is:
 - Get a question, write a solution if possible or report as not a question.
 - Once you are on it write a little document about the question and your solution

## Design this repo

A big contribution and appreciated would be to help in designing better this github repository.
You can start with an issue so that we can start talking.

# Algos ownership

If you wrote a really good algorithm you might want to ask how ownership and copyrights might work.

These are my guidelines:

 - The code will be under the repo license which means the latest GPL license.
   ** We have no meaning to fight for a license so we go for a classical one.
   ** We also cannot really set up a per algo licensing system right now

 - The documentation is indeed under GPL right now, but will require an update to fit better
   with a document based license. Of course CC (CreativeCommons) is under consideration. In principle this would
   effect the directory: "discussions".

 - Ownership: Within git and github there will exist a trace of the author.
   But in order to make this explicit I invite you to write for each code you submit
   a line like: "#Author: name surname <name.surname@email.address>
   and eventually your github member page.
   We will try to make this more explicit but for the time being we might need to survive with
   git commits authors.
